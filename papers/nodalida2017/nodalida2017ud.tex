\begin{abstract}
    We describe the first effort to annotate a signed language with syntactic
    dependency structure: the Swedish Sign Language portion of the
    Universal Dependencies treebanks.
    The visual modality presents some unique challenges in analysis and
    annotation, such as the possibility of
    both hands articulating separate signs simultaneously, which has
    implications for the central concept of \emph{projectivity}.
    Our data is sourced from the Swedish Sign Language Corpus,
    and if used in conjunction these resources contain very richly
    annotated data: dependency structure and parts of speech,
    video recordings, signer metadata, and because the whole material is
    also translated into Swedish the corpus is also a parallel text.

\section{Introduction}

The Universal Dependencies (UD) project \cite{Nivre2016ud} 
has produced a language-independent but extensible standard for
morphological and syntactic annotation using a formalism based on
dependency grammar. This standard has been used to create the Universal
Dependencies treebanks \cite{ud14}, which in its latest release at the time of
writing (version 1.4) contains 64 treebanks in 47 languages---one of which is
Swedish Sign Language (SSL, ISO 639-3: \textsc{swl}), the topic of this
article.


\section{Universal Dependencies}

The Universal Dependencies project aims to provide uniform morphological and
syntactic (in the form of dependency trees) annotations across languages
\cite{Nivre2016ud}.\footnote{Note that our work predates version 2 of the UD
guidelines, and is based on the first version.}
Built on a language-universal common core of 17 parts of speech and
40 dependency relations, there are also language-specific guidelines which
interpret and when necessary extend those in the context of a given language.

\section{Swedish Sign Language}

Swedish Sign Language (SSL) is the main sign language of the Swedish Deaf community.\footnote{Capital D ``Deaf'' is generally used to refer to the language community as a cultural and linguistic group, rather than `deaf' as a medical label.} It is estimated to be used by at least 10,000 as one of their primary languages, and is the only sign language to be recognized in Swedish law, giving it a special status alongside the official minority languages \cite{Ahlgren2006sou,Parkvall2015siffror}. The history of SSL goes back at least 200 years, since the inauguration of the first Deaf school in Sweden, and has influenced the two sign languages of Finland (i.e.~Finnish Sign Language and Finland-Swedish Sign Language) with which SSL can be said to be related \cite{Bergman2010transmission}.

\section{Data source}

The SSL Corpus Project ran during the years 2009--2011 with the intention to establish the first systematically designed and publicly available corpus of SSL, resulting in the SSL Corpus (SSLC). Approximately 24 hours of video data of dyadic signing was recorded, comprising 42 signers of different age, gender, and geographical background, spanning 300 individual video files \cite{Mesch2012signed}. The translation and annotation work is still on-going, with new releases being available online as the work moves forward. The last official release of the SSLC includes just under 7 hours of video data \cite{Mesch2012dataset} along with annotation files containing 53,625 sign tokens across 6,197 sign types \cite{Mesch2016annotated}. 

The corpus is annotated using the ELAN software \cite{Wittenburg2006elan}, and the annotation files are distributed in the corresponding XML-based \texttt{.eaf} format. Each annotation file contains tiers on which annotations are aligned with the a video file, both video and annotation tiers being visible in the ELAN interface (see \Fref{fig:sslc_elan}). The SSLC annotation files currently include tiers for sign glosses, and others for Swedish translations. Sign glosses are written word labels that represent signs with approximate meanings (e.g. \textsc{pro1} for a first person pronoun). The sign gloss annotation tiers are thus segmented for lexical items (i.e.~individual signs), and come in pairs for each signer---each tier representing one of the signer's hands \cite{Mesch2015gloss}. Sign glosses also contain a part-of-speech (PoS) tag which have been derived from manually correcting the output of a semi-automatic method for cross-lingual PoS tagging \cite{Ostling2015enriching}. The translation tier is segmented into longer chunks, representing stretches of discourse that can be represented by an idiomatic Swedish translation. However, the translation segmentations do not represent clausal boundaries in neither SSL nor Swedish \cite{Borstell2014segmenting}. More recently, a portion of the SSLC was segmented into clausal units and annotated for basic syntactic roles \cite{Borstell2016syntactic}, which led to the current UD annotation work. \Fref{fig:sslc_elan} shows the basic view of the SSLC videos and annotations in the ELAN software, with tiers for sign glosses and translations on the video timeline.

For practical purposes, annotation was performed by extending the ELAN
files of our source material from the SSLC project (see
\Fref{fig:sslc_elan_ud} for an example). These annotations were automatically
converted to the CoNLL-U format used by Universal Dependencies.

The annotation of UD based syntactic structure started by coming up with a procedure for annotating a signed language using ELAN. Signed language is more simultaneous than spoken language, particularly in the use of paired parallel articulators in form of the signer's two hands \cite{Vermeerbergen2007simultaneity}.
We handle this by allowing signs from both hands into the same tree structure,
which leads to well-formed trees consistent with the dependency grammar
formalism's single-head, connectedness and acyclicity constraints.
These trees can however have some unusual properties compared to spoken
languages.
For the purpose of conforming to the CoNLL-U data format,
which requires an ordered sequence of tokens, we sort
signs by onset time and break ties in favor of signs articulated by the
signer's dominant hand.
This working definition is by no means the only reasonable linearization,
which means that the notion of projectivity to some extent loses its meaning.
A tree can be considered projective or non-projective depending on how the
ordering of simultaneously articulated signs is defined---assuming one wants
to impose such an ordering in the first place.
An alternative to adapting the sign language data to fit the formalism,
as we have done in order to meet the requirements of the UD standards,
is obviously to construct a formalism adapted specifically to sign languages.
This is the path chosen by \newcite{Dubot2014ahybrid} in their parsing
experiments.
%Consider the example in \Fref{fig:ssl_dep}, which is non-projective
%due to the link between the two instances of \textsc{eat},
%but exchanging the order of \textsc{eat} and \textsc{look-at} would
%give us a projective tree.

Because the source material contains no segmentation above the sign level,
we decided to use a bottom-up annotation procedure where subtrees were
connected until we could find no more suitable mergers. The resulting fully
connected trees were then used as ``sentences'' in the CoNLL-U format.

%Because of this, and because the sign gloss annotation tiers are separate for the individual hands, we had to include one set of annotation tiers for each hand (i.e.~two per signer, or four per annotation file since there are two signers). We came up with an alignment system that combined the alignment with sign annotations and the linking of dependency relations between signs. Each tier set consisted of three tiers: \texttt{Index}; \texttt{Link}; and \texttt{UD}. The three tiers were generated using [[[technical stuff]]], creating dependent tiers to the sign gloss tiers. On the \texttt{Index} tier, each sign was assigned an integer based on its chronological position in the file (in case of overlapping signs, the onset was given precedence, or the dominant hand if onsets were identical)---this was done using a script iterating over all annotation files. On the \texttt{Link} tier, the index of the sign on which the sign was dependent was entered into each annotation cell. Lastly, on the \texttt{UD} tier, the dependency relation of a sign was entered into its annotation cell. Later, a custom script extracted this manually annotated data, and converted it into the CoNLL-U format used by the UD project. The method of using ELAN for linking and annotating dependency relations on parallel annotation tiers is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:sslc_elan_ud}.

\section{Treebank statistics}

\begin{figure}[tb]

	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{treesizes.pdf}
    \caption{Distribution of tree sizes for the Swedish Sign
        Language Universal Dependencies treebank.}
	\label{fig:treesizes}
\end{figure}

The SSL treebank released in version 1.4 of the UD treebanks
contains 82 trees with a total of 672 sign tokens (mean 8.2, median 7).
The distribution of tree sizes (in tokens) is shown in \Fref{fig:treesizes},
as described in \Fref{sec:annotation} these were produced in a bottom-up
fashion and reflect our judgment of the largest sensible syntactic
segmentation of the material.
As could be expected from a corpus of spontaneous conversation, there is a
large number of small trees. The most comparable (due to extensive contact)
written language, Swedish, has mean and median sentence lengths of 16.1 and
14, although that includes punctuation which is not present in the SSL
treebank.

\section{Dependency parsing}

Given that this is the first sign language UD treebank, we decided to perform
some dependency parsing experiments to establish some baseline results.



\section{Conclusions and future work}

In releasing the Universal Dependencies treebank of Swedish Sign Language
(SSL), the first such resource for a signed language,
we hope to enable new computational research into sign language syntax.
We also hope to stimulate the development of Natural
Language Processing (NLP) tools capable of processing sign languages.
Finally, because we have both parallel data in Swedish and language-independent
syntactic annotations, we also believe this resource could prove particularly
useful in cross-lingual NLP.
